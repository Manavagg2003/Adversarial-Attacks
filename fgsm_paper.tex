\begin{abstract}
Deep learning models, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), are vulnerable to adversarial attacksâ€”small perturbations in input images that lead to incorrect classifications. In this paper, we explore the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) attack on a trained CNN model using the CIFAR-10 dataset. We implement and analyze the impact of FGSM-generated adversarial examples on model performance. Our results demonstrate a significant drop in classification accuracy when adversarial examples are introduced, highlighting the security risks posed by such attacks.

\section{Introduction}
Deep learning models, especially CNNs, have achieved state-of-the-art accuracy in computer vision tasks. However, they remain susceptible to adversarial attacks, where carefully crafted perturbations can cause misclassification. The **Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM)** is a simple yet effective attack that leverages model gradients to generate adversarial examples. This study investigates the vulnerability of a trained CNN to FGSM attacks and visualizes their impact.

\section{Methodology}

\subsection{Dataset}
We use the **CIFAR-10** dataset, consisting of **60,000 images across 10 classes**. The dataset is split into **50,000 training** and **10,000 test images**. Images are **normalized and converted into PyTorch tensors** for processing.

\subsection{Model Architecture}
The CNN model (\texttt{SimpleCNN}) consists of:
\begin{itemize}
    \item A convolutional layer with 32 filters (ReLU activation).
    \item A fully connected (FC) layer for classification into 10 classes.
    \item Cross-entropy loss function and the Adam optimizer for training.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{FGSM Attack Implementation}
We implement FGSM by computing the gradient of the loss w.r.t. the input image and applying a small perturbation (\(\epsilon\)) in the direction of the gradient:

\begin{equation}
    x_{\text{adv}} = x + \epsilon \cdot \text{sign}(\nabla_x J(\theta, x, y))
\end{equation}

Where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( x_{\text{adv}} \) is the adversarial image.
    \item \( \epsilon \) controls perturbation strength.
    \item \( \nabla_x J(\theta, x, y) \) is the gradient of the loss w.r.t. the input.
\end{itemize}

The perturbation remains **imperceptible to humans** but significantly affects model predictions.

\section{Experimental Setup}

\subsection{Model Training}
We trained \texttt{SimpleCNN} on CIFAR-10 using **five epochs**, achieving an accuracy of **85\%** on clean images.

\subsection{FGSM Attack Execution}
We applied FGSM to test images with **\(\epsilon = 0.1\)**, generating adversarial examples.

\subsection{Visualization of Adversarial Examples}
Original and adversarial images were displayed using the \texttt{show\_images()} function, revealing slight perturbations that mislead the model.

\end{table}

\begin{itemize}
    \item The **adversarial accuracy dropped significantly** from **85.6\% to 12.4\%**.
    \item **Visualizations** showed **subtle but effective modifications** in the images.
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion \& Future Work}
This study confirms the vulnerability of CNNs to FGSM attacks. Future work includes:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Exploring stronger attacks (PGD, Carlini \& Wagner).
    \item Implementing defenses such as adversarial training.
    \item Testing on larger datasets (ImageNet, MNIST).
\end{enumerate}
